Creational
Many programming languages, known as object-oriented programming languages, have elements called classes and objects.
An object is a type of data you can create in a program that has a set of attributes. A class is a template you
can use to create an instance of an object.

For example, you might create a program that uses a car as an object. Two attributes of the car
are its color and type. You can include these attributes as data for the car object.
Once you've defined the attributes of the car, you can use multiple classes to create different
instances of the car object with different attributes, like a class with a red SUV and a class with a blue truck.

Creational design patterns are templates for creating classes and objects. Here are a few examples
of creational design patterns:

Factory method: You can use the factory method to create an object securely.
Singleton: The Singleton pattern creates a single instance of a class.
